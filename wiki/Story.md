## Part 01: Path of Liberation

In the imperial year 1347 on the continent of Tridera, an oppressive silence reigns as the terrible war that spread fear and terror is currently interrupted by a ceasefire, but no one knows how long this peace will last. A mighty mountain range separates the warring armies from each other, but there is a small territory at the southernmost point of the mountains that lies amidst the tensions: Bellum, an imposing metropolis whose affiliation has been unclear since its foundation. As it lies exactly at the border of all countries, it is a strategically important point for the war. However, the fear of a resumption of the fighting and a renewed battle for Bellum is ever-present.
